\section{Future of the project}

Here are a few improvements which are going to be implemented as iterations during further development of the robot. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of a realtime operating system such as FreeRTOS\footnote{https://www.freertos.org/} for a better control of tasks and their priorites.
    \item Implementation of HSE for a higher frequency and thus more precise measurements made by the controller
    \item Chosing a battery for the power supply
    \item Switching from the digital to analog input so that the robot can steer while moving in a direction.
\end{itemize}
