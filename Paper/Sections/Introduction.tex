\section{Introduction}

The main purpose of this project is to build a rover which has the following functionalities. Speed of the rover can be controller by turning a knob on its top. Direction can be directly controlled by user via bluetooth. When a robot gets close to an obstacle (17cm) it blocks the movement in the direction of the obstacle until it is either cleared or the rover is far away enough again. The paper will not be covering the physical assembly of the non-electronic parts.
