\section{Conclusion}

This type of rover could prove itself quite useful since it has the ability of turning itself in one spot while maintaining the balance of a four wheeled vehicle. As a cheap solution the rover can be used in many applications and the low power consumption only adds up to its usability. Currently, the prototype hasn't been built for further testing but the logic and the configuration have been tested by using the Proteus tool.
